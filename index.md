# Java Design Patterns
* Design patterns are best practices to design object-oriented solutions.
* Design patterns evolved over a period of time and there are specific, Design 
  patterns to specific problems domains, with proven results.
* Apart from being a guideline to Object Oriented Program Design,
  it also provides a common wordage or jargon, that is accepted by the 
  developer community.

## Philosophy of Design patterns 
1. Program to an interface not an implementation
   * Interface is like a template or a design and Implementation is 
     the actual code, Consider Sort() as Interface and implementation of Sort()
     could be QuickSort() or RadixSort().
   * This means there could be a better implementation for a given purpose 
     but declaring the purpose itself is important.
2. Favor object composition over inheritance  
   * Object Composition is the objective that classes must provide polymorphism.
     Inheritance feature provides access of parent class members to a childclass.
     Polymorphism feature provides the ability to change the behaviour of a
     parent class methods in the childclass.
